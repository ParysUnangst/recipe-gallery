## Layout and Styling Choices

The recipe gallery displays a curated list of recipes in a visually appealing manner. Here's a brief overview of the layout and styling choices:

- Each recipe card is presented as a separate component, making it easy to navigate and interact with individual recipes.
- The title of each recipe is displayed prominently using an `<h2>` element, ensuring it catches the user's attention.
- A representative image is included for each recipe, providing a visual representation of the dish. Images are either sourced from external URLs or imported directly into the project for better performance and control.
- The list of ingredients for each recipe is presented in a clear and organized manner using an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`).
- Minimal styling is applied to maintain simplicity and focus on content. The use of clean typography, subtle borders, and spacing ensures that the recipes are easy to read and visually appealing.
- Responsive design principles are followed to ensure that the recipe gallery looks good and functions well across different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless user experience.
